### Day 21: August 25, 2024 (Sunday)

Hey hey I think I'm done for today. We were able to finish two projects today and I'm pretty proud of that. The first one was freeCodeCamp's simple date formatter which introduced me to the date object and how to use it. The only change I did was again with the UI and then I formatted the months to be their actual names instead of numbers. I planned to do more with the project, but I moved on to doing TOP's etch a sketch project. To be honest I still didn't know how to start this one. Practically all projects I couldn't start purely by myself. That just means I'm still pretty much a beginner at JavaScript. So yeah, ChatGPT did a lot of heavy lifting for me with this project. I mean I understand the code behind it, considering how little the code needed to function was, but to be honest it probably will take me some time to do this entirely by myself with no AI or with minimal searching. Still credit where credit's due, you did a great job with the UI, that we did'nt need help from and you also fixed some bugs which I know the past us wouldn't be able to do.

Keep going me, I might have less time tomorrow to prepare for the next school loop, but do still try to study web development as much as you can. Continue your readings and do the freeCodeCamp projects if that bores you. Good luck tomorrow.

### Day 20: August 24, 2024 (Saturday)

I finally finished TOP's JavaScript exercises today, but I gave in and started using AI to help me solve them. I did not solely rely on AI, it's only when I got stuck and couldn't find the answer elsewhere that I turned to it. This time though I promise that I won't be relying on it too much and always. I'm gonna make a conscious effort to only use it when necessary or after struggling for a while. After finishing the JavaScript exercises I went ahead and finished the rock paper scissors in the console project, and then read through the DOM Manipulation lesson. There's still the assignment left which is a lot of reading, but for now I'll continue in doing the Rock Paper Scissors project, this time with a UI. I'll come back to this after I hopefully finish it today.

### Day 19: August 23, 2024 (Friday)

Sup, it's the first day of our 4-day weekend, and I've done a bit of coding today, more than I did this past week. I'm hoping this will increase more tomorrow. Anyways, I first attempted to finish the TOP's JavaScript exercises, but I couldn't get all of them to work. I think I stopped at just exercise 4, because I couldn't solve it fast enough, and I didn't want to result to using AI to solve it, of course I still searched for answers, but I'm not sure if I did it right. So I switched to freeCodeCamp's JavaScript course, and I managed to finish the music player project today. I learned a lot about different string and array methods, and how to use them. Although our focus was a bit shifted earlier, I'm glad we still spent a lot of time on it today. Tomorrow I plan to learn some Android Development to prepare for our future project like I mentioned yesterday. I just need to be familiar with it. Also don't forget to practice some design skills while you're at it. Remember we're gonna be working primarily as a designer on our group activity, so even if you do know a bit of graphic design, UI and UX is a different field, and your Figma skills are not on par with your Photoshop skills.

Still try to squeeze in web development on your learning, because that's one career we see ourselves in, but also don't neglect what's important in your university studies - which right now is Android Development, and UI/UX Design. Good job today, keep it up.

### Day 18: August 22, 2024 (Thursday)

Hey tomorrow is the start of a long weekend and my goal is to finish or come close to finishing the Foundations course. We've been slacking off a lot this week, granted it's only our second week since going back to school, but we've been given an opportunity of a long weekend. Please don't waste this time doing unnecessary bs. I trust you know what to do. Don't fuck up.

Anyways today, I only partially read through the loops lesson in MDN, didn't even do the active recall lessons, but I started the TOP's javascript exercises, and had an experiment with npm through their exercises and learned briefly about Test Driven Development. Let's focus up tomorrow as soon as we wake up, ditch the phone, go straight to the laptop and start learning early in the morning. So even if we fuck up, which we probably will we'd have done some amount of studying early in the morning. Who knows once we get started with studying we just might not stop, so better to improve your chances and just do it in the morning. Also we need start preparing for our eventual group projects. I think I'll mostly be assuming a designer role, but that doesn't mean you have to neglect programming, especially the backend altogether. It pays to know a lot, and not just one. We can do both, and maybe more, it just needs a little more dedication and hard work.

Good luck tomorrow. Remember, go straight to studying as soon as you wake up.

### Day 17: August 21, 2024 (Wednesday)

I couldn't study some code today, but I did manage to redesign the calorie counter project, and finish it today. I just realized some features are not working as intended, and I plan to come back to it some time. The important thing is I managed to redesign yet another website adding to my experience. It's still practice and definitely not portfolio worthy. I haven't been researching much on these redesigns and basically just doing it raw. My process is basically get color, get fonts, do a basic layout in figma, then code. Good for practice, but in the real world I doubt they do that, so for my next project. I'm gonna try a little harder and actually do some research to my designs and improve my workflow. Anyways, gonna call it a day now and sleep. After tomorrow my schedule will be opening up again for almost week, so use that time wisely.

### Day 16: August 20, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hey hey, we're at Day 16, well kind of. I did some Java for the first time today. I reviewed for a bit early in the morning, but it wasn't enough because I pretty much had to rely on AI when doing our activity. I mean I can kinda understand most parts of it, but if I had to do everything from scratch, which I tried - I definitely would not succeed at that moment. We only had at best 2 hours to complete almost 10 exercises, so really that was my only choice. Don't worry though I still will avoid using AI on my separate studies. I just had to this time.

Other than some Java review on our classes, the only code-related thing I did was try to add some design to the previous calorie counter project I did on freeCodeCamp. That is until I distracted myself by playing League of Legends. Lock in :3

### Day 15: August 19, 2024 (Monday)

It's Day 15 and a Monday, I've only read some lessons again today. The first one where I had to install Node JS, and after that I've read a bit on arrays, again. If things go right tonight, and If I'm not sleepy I might review some Java for tomorrow. Still not used to the new schedule, but please try harder. Lock in.

### Day 14: August 18, 2024 (Sunday)

Can't believe it's been two weeks already. Although my pace is slowing down a lot, I'll eventually get that momentum back once I get used to going to school while simultaneously doing this. I only did one lesson today in The Odin Project about Clean Code. I spent way too much time gaming today, but I guess I'll let it slide since it's only once a week, and today is a weekend. I'll see you tomorrow, make sure to prepare for your classes.

### Day 13: August 17, 2024 (Saturday)

It's officially Day 13, and almost 2 weeks from when I first started this challenge. It's difficult doing this while I have classes and other responsibilities, but we kinda did this to ourselves because we didn't start sooner. But enough of the self blame, the second best thing is now, and you'll always have now, what's important is you keep taking action every now.

Anyways, short pep talk over - Today I attempted to build rock paper scissors from scratch, and failed, kind of. I'll try to fix it tomorrow, and finally finish watching some rock paper scissors tutorial on YouTube, because reading is still not enough for me. Prior to that I had finished the short rock paper scissors project in freeCodeCamp, but I kept it separate from The Odin Project, because I wanted to work within TOP's rules. I almost finished all the test cases, but yeah I encountered some bugs I wasn't able to fix yet. Still I did improve the design of the freeCodeCamp rock paper scissors, and I'm quite proud of that. Good job me.

It's only 6pm while I'm writing this, but I need to clear some of my backlogs, the most important being this video I need to record. I've set up Java in my VS Code, but I still need to review it, especially because we're doing Android Development for our course. I have some experience with it, but I remember not liking doing Android that much, hopefully it will change this time.

### Day 12: August 16, 2024 (Friday)

Hey it's Day 12, and I just finished the [Calorie Counter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#learn-form-validation-by-building-a-calorie-counter) project from freeCodeCamp. My online class was supposed to last until 8 PM, but luckily it didn't, giving me plenty of time to finally finish this lesson which took about 2 days I think, I remember being able to do one for less than a day, but yeah can't be helped since it's no longer summer and the challenge is to juggle both my independent studies and college, and not prioritize one over the other.

Anyways, while I didn't understand the full process of how this calorie counter was built - what's important is I learned some new concepts and techniques on how to build things. I think that's what great about freeCodeCamp, because even If I don't what is going on, I'm subconsciously learning some great practices that I'll keep using. It'd be great if I completely know the why, but right now I'm satisfied that I know the how of building something. I'll publish this project again, experiment on it and this time try to change more than the appearance of the project.

Good job today, enjoy your weekend, but don't forget what you gotta do. We're lacking some preparation that you'd really benefit from in the long run. Do those too, tomorrow aside from this. Keep going me.

### Day 11: August 15, 2024 (Thursday)

It's Day 11 now, and I have to admit that I was pretty "lazy" today. I went home from school at around 5 PM, which was plenty of time for me to study, but I didn't. Instead I spent this free time doing God knows what. I honestly don't know what happened, I'm probably just tired because this was the first time this week, that I went home kinda early, and didn't walk all the way from school.

I still did a few freeCodeCamp lessons today which were mainly about working with regex, but it didn't amount to an hour. I could've done more today, but hey you deserve some rest. Tomorrow, we have a full day of online classes, even if that's the case I think I can squeeze in some dev time. It may be difficult to do lessons while listening to classes, but I can definitely design and develop websites while that's happening, which I'll try again tomorrow.

Anyways, lock in. Remember your goals and push through even if you don't feel like it. Good luck tomorrow.

### Day 10: August 14, 2024 (Wednesday)

Yo it's Day 10, it's only 8:30 PM but I'm call it a day, because I'm tired. I managed to squeeze in some dev time during my easier subjects. Not necessarily easy but it was just a short orientation so I spent that time building and debugging the number guessing game from MDN. And just now I was able to fix one annoying bug, which was really just a simple fix. This is my fault for not trusting the Chrome Dev Tools, because I was entirely convinced that one element was causing the problem, until I inspected it and it was a completely different element, which I was then able to fix immediately. Always keep the developers tools open. Lesson learned. Trust the devtools, study the devtools.

Anyways after that I did a couple of freeCodeCamp lessons. I'm on the Building a Calorie Counter part, I hope I can continue more tomorrow. Goodnight, good luck and keep going.

### Day 9: August 13, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hello it's Day 9 and today was my shortest study session so far. I think I only crammed about an hour or so in the morning. I think I finished 2 lessons in The Odin Project today which was Problem Solving and Understanding Errors. I finally did one of MDN's active learning section earlier - the one about error handling, and they were pretty good. I finally forked their repo and I might just have to finish it all sometime.

After I got home from school, I finally attempted the rock paper scissors project, and then failed when I realized I still couldn't do it from scratch without searching for answers immediately. I figured I'll save this project for when I can comfortably do it without guides. That's when I made the switch to freeCodeCamp again and finished one quick lesson earlier, surprisingly about debugging. I also practiced my frontend skills a bit by improving the UI of said project. I think I'll stick with freeCodeCamp for now at least until I finish their rock paper scissors project, which they also have. Anyways, good job again today, keep doing this.

### Day 8: August 12, 2024 (Monday)

Hey it's Day 8, and today was the first day of me being a 3rd Year Computer Science Student. The subject was calculus earlier and we reviewed Algebra, which I embarrassingly struggled with a lot. I will definitely get back on reviewing Algebra. Do not make this an excuse. WE CAN DO BOTH. We just need to plan things better, it's only the first week things will get better, you'll find your groove.

Anyways, back to our independent studies. You made the right decision earlier of doing this early in the morning when you still had time. Tomorrow we might not have enough time, but try to squeeze in at least an hour of just reading shit and immersing yourself to the programming culture. I think we have some spare time in between classes you can use that. Read when you can't code. It still counts.

Now back to what we accomplished today. I only managed to kinda complete one lesson in Odin which was about Problem Solving. After that I went ahead and played around with the freeCodeCamp project I did yesterday, and I just finished it, check it out [here](https://adiluexe.github.io/basic-js-rpg/) in all it's mediocre glory.

I did not add a lot in the JavaScript part of the code. It's mostly improving the copywriting and design of things, which I'm still proud of. I added new description objects for the monsters; updated the dialogue and options; and overhauled the entire UI. My JavaScript skills still suck, but I'm definitely getting better at CSS and the frontend side of things. Of course I'm still confused on why it's not being responsive like I thought it would, I keep using `100vh` for the landing page and it's not working right when the page content is larger than that or when I scale it down. But that's beside the point, I made stuff today, just keep making stuff, eventually everything will just be natural to you. Keep going me, good luck, and see you tomorrow.

### Day 7: August 11, 2024 (Sunday)

It's officially been a week since I started learning how to code, again (fr this time). I'm 75% through TOP's Foundation Course in just a week! This took me months when I first stumbled upon this course. That being said, I wasn't speeding through or anything, in fact I only kinda finished one lesson today in TOP, which was the Function Basics along with its assignment. There were a lot of readings that I skimmed through and plan to read through again tomorrow. This time I once again focused on freeCodeCamp, specifically the [Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game) project which I finished in one sitting today. My plan tomorrow is to maybe finish the TOP lessons until the first project, and then revamp the project I just finished in freeCodeCamp.

I know that we'll be starting of our classes tomorrow, but don't make that an excuse you know you can squeeze in at least 2 hours of your time everyday with this. We've always done well at school, somehow, but I know you also realize that being just good at university and having high grades isn't enough. I'm not asking you to prioritize one thing over another, I'm asking you to do both, and I know you can. Do well in class, while also doing your independent studies. I'm proud of you. Keep going. I'll see you tomorrow, and everyday after that.

### Day 6: August 10, 2024 (Saturday)

Day 6 and almost a week through. Today I started learning about JavaScript. I only managed to complete 2 lessons in the JavaScript basics of TOP. There was too much reading involved about something I'm not used to yet. I figured rather than force myself into that and kill my momentum (I almost didn't wanna study today), I should just switch resources, which was part of my plan after all. That's why I started freeCodeCamp's JS Course. I managed to finish the first two projects, which gave me the motivation to read through the lessons set by TOP, which was still hard to go through.

I kinda skipped over the Dev Tools part again, but tomorrow I'll watch like a couple videos on it instead. I was surprised that I was able to study for around 5 hours today, because I did not start off motivated with all the reading. Good on you for having plans in case this happens, and following through with it.

If TOP is getting difficult for you, switch to freeCodeCamp, if even that is getting to be too difficult for you, watch some videos about the topic, and if that still doesn't work - take a break. You might just be tired. Anyways, good job for today, keep at it.

### Day 5: August 9, 2024 (Friday)

Day 5. I just finished the Flexbox section, including the flexbox exercises, and the landing page project. I pretty much finished the flexbox exercises in under and hour this time, and without looking anything up. That's right no Google, no ChatGpt, just pure experience. I remember struggling with this section when I first encountered, and me taking like almost a week to finish it all. Naturally, my confidence was at an all time high having finished something I struggled with for days, in less than an hour.

I thought I had mastered CSS layouts by now, but when I attempted the landing page page - I realized I still had a long way to go. I particularly struggled with how my sections keep overlapping, and overflowing with each other. But credit where credit's due :3, I did do this in like 2 hours while watching The Umbrella Academy on the side, and I did eventually fix it.

Keep going me, we spent a little over 6 hours today, I'm proud of you.

### Day 4: August 8, 2024 (Thursday)

Sup it's Day 4 and I'm 56% through the Foundations Course. I just finished the margin and padding css exercises and I'm gonna end today there, tomorrow we'll start with Flexbox and hopefully at the JavaScript section which I'm still struggling with.

We basically started off today at the Commit Messages lesson which I reread, then did the recipes project. I still haven't added the styles yet for that, but I'm definitely gonna do like a big project with it when I'm almost done with the Foundations Course which I believe we can do for about a month, since we've already progressed through it 2 times, and now's the third. Anyways, I pretty much breezed through the CSS lessons and the exercises. I did kinda skip through the Chrome Dev Tools part, I'll save that for next time, I figured rather than force myself to study that part and lose momentum, I'd rather save it for another time where I'll absolutely need it. I did like knowing about the `CSS Overview` part of the Dev Tools. Now that's something that I know is immediately useful for me.

We also spent around 4 hours today, good job again. Classes are coming up soon, but I hope you still remember to do these independent studies and keep logging here. Again, good job me.

### Day 3: August 7, 2024 (Wednesday)

Yo it's Day 3 and my mom's birthday, someday I hope to give her the life she deserves.

I'm 41% through the Foundations Course in The Odin Project (TOP), I'm right about done with the Commit Messages lesson, but I will read through it again tomorrow. I basically blitzed through the HTML sections and read the additional sources in case there's some info I missed. I recently finished the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course so I think I'll revisit that if my HTML still needs some work.

I spent around 4 hours studying today, the longest session we've had so far. You're doing great me, keep it up.

### Day 2: August 6, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hey it's Day 2 and I'm 20% through with the Foundations Course, I'm almost finished with the Prerequisites section, I spent almost 4 hours today with The Odin Project, about 1 hour of that was trying to setup WSL2 in my device. I had installed it previously, but I thought It wasn't working so I reinstalled it again, and that's where I encountered some problems and spent extra time on, but it's all hopefully over.

I mostly learned about computers today, and some background on the web and basically things related to it. I'm nearly done with the Command Line Basics, but I think It's better if I finish it tomorrow. It's currently 8pm while I'm writing this and I'm gonna call it day, need to rest even if I think I could still do more. You deserve it, keep up the good work.

### Day 1: August 5, 2024 (Monday)

I started The Odin Project from the beginning for like I think the 3rd time again. (This time will be different ;3).

I'm 10% through the Foundations Course, having just finished reading through the Introduction section. I think I spent a total of 3 hours studying today, I definitely could've done more, regardless, good job me.

Mostly learned about how to develop the mindset that will make help me succeed in everything. Here's to making it.
