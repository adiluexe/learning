### Day 34: September 7, 2024 (Saturday)

Sup, it's the weekend and I continued my review on the design software I'll be using. I tried to read through TOP for the first time in a while, I attempted the Forms project, but yeah I felt reluctant to do it. Instead I decided to just continue with my design lessons, after all I'll be needing it sooner than learning web development. Although I'll be using those lessons for when I build my website portfolio. Anyways, today I did an hour long Figma Crash Course, again from BYOL. I'm really liking his way of teaching, wish I had the money to buy his premium courses, but his free stuff is also, but makes me want to check out his premium courses. Maybe tomorrow we'll do that, if I have an easy way to access it. After finishing that I went ahead and watched this 3-hour Web Design Course for beginners by Flux Academy, which was well made and real professional. Though I found it harder to focus on it, because it was less interactive than what I was used to with BYOL's courses. Still it was helpful and jam packed with new resources I got to check out like Relume and YouWorkForThem, but I guess it's more geared towards people who have more experience, rather than absolute beginners which BYOL's courses are for. I also got to witness the power of Webflow for the first time today, though I didn't use it firsthand. It seems to be a great tool for creating websites in a likely easier way since it's drag and drop, but I'll stick to actually learning web development for now, because I might get used to it. Reminder - no easy website builders for you, you're gonna have to learn web development the real way (not judging people who use it). Anyways, good job me, keep it up. Let's finish the advanced Illustrator and Figma course tomorrow, and finally start the branding of our project - good on you for starting with the moodboard for the logo already. See you tomorrow.

### Day 33: September 6, 2024 (Friday)

Yo I finally finished that Android research paper assignment I've putting off for weeks now. Feels good. Now just pretend you don't care about the outcome and just move on with your life. Especially since next week is gonna be real heavy for your workload. That's still not gonna stop us from doing what we want, right? I want to start freelancing again and to do that we need to start learning design, designing again, posting again in instagram, and remaking your portfolio. While we'll be assuming a designer role for most of this, I don't want you to neglect your programming skills. Because I guarantee you we need that and we're gonna be wearing that hat a lot, design is just the cherry on top, your edge. So I want you to realize that it's crucial to balance both, and also school - I keep forgetting that part. I still want us to do well in school, but yeah better to build my technical, more practicals skills first than try and compete and see who'll get the best grades and be the best student. I mean I already was the "best" once in my first year in terms of grades, yet I still felt like a fraud, because there were a lot I deemed more successful than me, they were earning money already, and they had better skills at programming, even though It seemed that I was better at them at school. That's been my relationship with university so far, I'm still gonna aim high, I think that's more than possible, I do want to graduate with honors. My point is you can do both, you can do everything, as long as you manage your time well. Let's say 40% of your energy goes to class, but realistically I'd say we're only putting in about 20% to it, and that's fine it fluctuates, it will naturally be higher when things become more important. Just know your priority and the secret is just finishing things immediately. You've organized your to-do list already, so just do them. Tomorrow morning we'll do them, like seriously do them.

Anyways this was supposed to be just a log of what I learned today, but it kinda evolved into a debate of some sort. Speaking of what I learned, I finished the Adobe Illustrator Beginner's Course by Bring Your Own Laptop. That's my GOAT teacher, wish I could've accessed the full course because there were like 4 hours more of it, maybe in my free time I'll sail the high seas for it. I also will started his Illustrator Advanced Course, and plan to finish it tomorrow. I'm gonna make a comeback on graphic design, and start posting again on Instagram. Also, I got access to a licensed Adobe subscription, meaning I can finally use legit copies of Adobe software. Things are looking good for me. God is real, and huge thanks to my friend for letting me borrow her Creative Cloud account. See you tomorrow, don't fuck things up and sabotage yourself. Momentum, we have that, don't waste it. Good luck.

### Day 32: September 5, 2024 (Thursday)

Sup, it's Day 32 - I fumbled again earlier today, but I quickly came back to it and not let it linger for the rest of the day. You know what I'm talking about. Anyways, I finally finished that beginner Flutter project from their documentation, and Flutter is pretty cool. I like the hot reload thing they have, and their UI themes. I don't think it' possible or I've just yet to encounter it in Android Studio. My problem is I'm not used to programming the Flutter way, there's just too many nestings, wrappings, and more shenanigans that I have yet to deal with, but the documentation's pretty good and they have a very intuitive workflow. I also tried to learn React Native today but yeah I had a terrible start and their documentation is a bit lacking and really not beginner friendly, at least compared to Flutter and Android Studio. I might still check it out some other time, maybe it's just a skill issue, but installing and running Flutter and Android Studio was a way smoother experience to me than my attempt at React Native. I'll probably encounter it once I start learning React, but right now my choices are Android Studio and Flutter.

Afterwards I had that brief slump I mentioned earlier, so I needed a change of pace. I installed Adobe Illustrator again and started Bring Your Own Laptop 4 hour course about the overview of Adobe Illustrator. I guess this is my first time with Graphic Design in months, and I'm planning on making a comeback on it and perhaps start posting again on Instagram. I've got a pretty decent account that I left, I don't know if I should continue with it, or just start a new one and see where it goes. This time though I plan to utilize Illustrator more. I'll especially needing it these days because we're close to the Design Phase of our project, which is why I'll be needing it to create a logo. I also should review some Figma after finishing the Illustrator course, because I'll be diving more into UI/UX Design. Good job me, we fucked up again, but we bounced back pretty quickly this time. I'm glad you understood this time that we didn't have to wait a day or two before trying again just because we made a mistake. Keep showing up, keep being better. Goodnight, and ah I forgot to do school loop again. Tomorrow, I will 100% finish my school works. Not my fault that what I do here is more interesting, but there's no escaping it. Just do the thing. Good luck tomorrow.

### Day 31: September 4, 2024 (Wednesday)

Yo, it's actually been a month now since I started documenting my learning. We've progressed quite a lot during our first month, even if we did fuck up several times, I'm still proud of you. There may be times when we fuck up, like yesterday, but the important thing is we keep going, we stand, and just show up. Keep showing up, eventually everything will be yours.

Today I explored Flutter, it's actually pretty good and runs way faster than Kotlin with Android Studio. I'm still in the beginning part of both these technologies, so there's definitely more to it but I'm having fun just exploring stuff. Maybe tomorrow I'll even check out React Native, which I'm a hesitant to use because I hate React already. So about Flutter, I'm currently in the middle of their write your first app tutorial, which I'll hopefully finish today. I set it up earlier and explored some Flutter apps, but right now I need to attempt to build my own by following along their documentation. I'm more of a documentation type of guy now, trying to use less YouTube tutorials and just go straight to the source. Anyways I don't want to waste time, I'll see you tomorrow, and I'll tell you how it goes. Hopefully we still don't have face to face classes tomorrow, because I enjoy just learning on my own and no other reason at all :3 _queue that one Parasite (2019) scene_.

### Day 30: September 3, 2024 (Tuesday)

Today was not a good day. I think the only studying I did was watch a couple YouTube videos related to programming, but I literally do that everyday. I'll try to redeem myself after reading a bit more in my phone, but yeah today was a terrible day for me. I planned to continue learning Android Development today, and also finish my Android research paper assignment, but I couldn't. Something just clicked today, and I couldn't function as well as I did yesterday. I basically watched anime all morning, played some games, and then had a meeting with my group related to our project, which probably is the only good thing I did today, still if I was functioning normally, I could've achieved better. Gonna sleep early today. We fucked up a lot, but we'll be back soon. I'm sorry for disappointing you.

### Day 29: September 2, 2024 (Monday)

Sup - I finally started learning about Android Development. Who knew that the official Android Developer website made by Google would have the best resource for learning Android Development? That should be a no-brainer, but it took me weeks to get to that point. The next time we try to learn something just go to the official documentation of what you want to learn, and then start from there - instead of going to YouTube and waste time filtering actual good videos, just use the official documentation. I love the Google Developer Program.

Anyways, I'm almost done with Unit 1 of their Android Basics With Compose course. I learned the basics of Kotlin which convinced me enough to use it instead of Java for developing our app. Now I just need to relay it to my group, and then everything will hopefully go smooth. It does have some weird quirks that I'm not used to like how a variable is declared, but it does have type inference which makes the process easier. I just need to get used to it, seeing as it's way shorter than Java. The jump from Kotlin basics to actually coding stuff in Android Studio was a bit overwhelming, but I'll get used to it. I remember it being the same the first time I tried Android Development. There's just a lot of template code generated code that you'd have to figure out yourself, especially since I'm running the latest version of Android Studio and I think the course was made in 2022. Other than that today was great. I managed to run it using my phone, which was way faster than the emulator. I also tried it using Wi-Fi but failed, and I didn't want to waste time debugging that problem. Unfortunately no Web Development practice today, but I'll see if I can tomorrow considering we don't have classes again. By the way today's classes were cancelled, so good on you for using it wisely. Although we're still ignoring our assignments, but I'd argue that what I've done today is worth it and probably better than what I will learn trying to spend time with that assignment. Still, we ain't shit yet, so don't complain too much and just finish your class related activities. Good job me. See you tomorrow.

### Day 28: September 1, 2024 (Sunday)

Yo, it's September 1 and I started off today kinda tired and groggy if that's the right word. So it was hard to function properly, fortunately I didn't break the streak and even read quite a lot of lessons today that I was able to finish all the Intermediate CSS lessons from TOP. I tried to go all the way today and finish the Form lessons and exercises, but my mind was off it. I did some school-related tasks today, mostly related to our group activities in HCI which is about UI/UX. Honestly I'm still confused about the requirements and what we have to do, so might as well prepare some stuff just in case. Also I completely ignored Android development again, and our research paper about Android development. I have a rough outline already, but I can't be bothered. We have 5 days left, so I'm hoping you get your shit together by done and finish that project. See ya tomorrow.

### Day 27: August 31, 2024 (Saturday)

Hey, last day of August today, and the clock keeps ticking. Anyway I mostly just read again today, with the exception of playing the CSS Diner, an interactive game where you learn about CSS selectors. I need to find more of these stuff, because they make learning entertaining. By the way I speedran through that game, making me more confident of my CSS skills. Maybe CSS will be my thing who knows. Apart from learning about advanced selector, I read through other intermediate CSS concepts. Like CSS units which I read through again today. A general rule of thumb is to just use more of rem which I've mostly been using already, but I want to try experimenting with viewport units more, and combine it with CSS functions like calc() and clamp() which I also read through today. I also learned some more CSS properties, Typography, how to optimize font loading, the best format, etcetera. And lastly about CSS positioning. Now I know why z-index isn't working when I tried to use it in a project a while ago. I need to set the position to something else other than the default. Also I get how top, left, bottom, right works now. Really useful if I knew it back in 9th Grade then I would've perfected that activity about positioning. Really puts into perspective how early I discovered web development. If only 15 year old me decided to continue pursuing it. I was even quite good at it that time at least compared to most of my classmates. Oh well no use regretting about it, the second best time to learn is now, and I'm 27 days in of (seriously, well most of the time) learning web development. Almost a month in this challenge, I'm proud of you. Good luck tomorrow. We kinda forgot to do prepare for the school loop, so Sunday's our last chance. You better now waste it.

### Day 26: August 30, 2024 (Friday)

Yo, I had no classes today because it is our seniors' graduation day. Remember it'll be use next year graduating, so I want you to take things more seriously. I had a a pretty unproductive start of the day, but we managed to pull through mid-day. We definitely could've done more had we not goofed off early on, but we make mistakes. I just hope you do better, and be mindful of how you use your time. Keep in mind that we have a year left to be the best version of ourselves to prepare for the transition to be a working adult. You're no longer in school in next year, so take this learning shit seriously and prepare for the future.

Anyways, I just read some lessons today. Unfortunately, we didn't quite do the Tables assessment, because it was starting to be boring for me. So I went ahead and just skimmed the rest of the tables lesson, and move on to the Intermediate CSS lessons, which I'm actually interested in and spent quite a few hours reading through it. I learned more about the browser default styles, and key topics such as CSS Reset, Reboot, and Normalize. In the end I think I'm sticking with Josh W. Comeau's CSS Reset, which is the simplest for me, but I want to go ahead and try `modern-normalize.css` and `sanitize.css` sometime. I also started the CSS Units lesson, but I'll continue reading through it tomorrow since I'm feeling really sleepy. My goal is to be consistent with my sleeping schedule again, so I'm gonna be closing this laptop off early, sleep early, and wake up early. Remember, 1 year left to get our shit together. I hope when you read through our logs again that you're already successful or in a much better place. Lock in. Good luck tomorrow, and good job today even if we spent half the day playing video games. Keep it up (not the playing video games all day art).

### Day 25: August 29, 2024 (Thursday)

Hey, feeling a little sick, but I started TOP's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course today. I think I'll end today of with the Tables lesson, I may or may not start the tables assessment today. Anyways, the lesson were basically a more general look to HTML, especially with the other tags and attributes. Note to self: start using the other content sectioning tags like `address, article, aside, nav, section and search`. I've mostly been using just div, plus header and footer. This time though let's incorporate those other tags. I also read through Emmet again which I have actually been using for a while now. The next lesson I read was about SVGs. All I know is that they're best for icons, or for images that you want to scale properly and that their format is more readable than their counterparts of jpeg and png. Finally, I stopped at the Tables lesson, I think I'm gonna continue with that tomorrow since it's an assessment of some sort and I feel really sick. Also I'm gonna publish a repository of my web-dev related bookmarks, because I don't know how to do bookmarks on Arc. See you tomorrow, keep it up. And I must tell you again, to learn some Android Development. It's literally your University homework to go learn Android, so we can cheat a little on the web dev stuff, even if we prefer it over mobile development. Our goal is to finish the Android research paper by Sunday, and know enough about Android by then. Alright. See ya.

### Day 24: August 28, 2024 (Wednesday)

I just finished the final project of TOP's Foundations Course, which is making the Calculator. Huge shoutout to WebDevSimplfied's tutorial, I definitely couldn't have done it without his video as a reference. It gave me a clear vision of why the OOP way is the standard in programming. I struggled a little with the UI, mainly on aligning the keys properly, because I used flexbox instead of CSS grid like with his tutorial. I didn't want to blindly follow him, especially when I'm more used to flexbox. I say that but I still pretty much followed step by step his logic on creating the JavaScript for it, but you know what I mean. Anyways, still proud of the project, unfortunately couldn't make it responsively wall the way through, because I set the size of the keys explicitly to make them all equal, and because I was running into some problems with aligning things. I'll leave it at that for now.D

And with that I finished TOP's Foundations Course today, and I'm pretty proud. I remember it took me a span of 3 months, maybe more the last time I attempted TOP, but I finally got it done, in less than a month this time. I probably could've done it in less time had I focused more, because there was a week where we barely did anything code related except for the one and two lessons and exercises I did to not break this streak. That just proves that you can do a lot, more than you realize it if you have the right amount of focus. It's only 4:25 pm while I'm writing this, I'm gonna rest a bit, but I'm sure we can do a whole lot more today. In a way It's good that classes were suspended today, and I'm glad you did this instead. Good job me, learn more, do more. Maybe I'll see you again later. Keep going with this.

### Day 23: August 27, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hey hey I almost broke the streak today, but I pushed through, at least for a little. I'm back on the school loop again, which messed my schedule up a bit, but considering I went home at around 2pm, because school ended quickly - it's kinda my fault for not doing more, and I definitely could've done way more. For starters we played just 1 game of league of legends, which fucked us over because of one bad game, after that I attempted to do some research for our group project, and attempted again to do my homeworks in advanced but I just couldn't, guess there's just some days like that, even if it's your fault entirely. The only fix I found was taking a bath, which I should've done sooner. This gave me the small push I needed to get back on track. In which I read through the final lesson of the Foundations Course, which was about objects. I skimmed through it, but of course since it's a heavy read I couldn't finish it. I'll attempt the assignments tomorrow, and also do the extra reading materials even if I'm bored of reading it.

Lock in. I'll see you tomorrow.

### Day 22: August 26, 2024 (Monday)

Today was a good day. I finished another project, which I'm quite proud of that being freeCodeCamp's Palindrome Checker. You can view it [here](https://adiluexe.github.io/palindrome-checker/). I quite like the UI I made and the small hover animations I added. I'm getting kinda sick of it so you should check out how to animate more in CSS, but a few months ago I wouldn't have been able to do or think about doing something like what I do today. The code for the palindrome checker was actually quite simple. I only needed to take the inputted string and reverse it, then compare it to the original string. The only thing which was kinda complicated was adding the regex values to clean the input when it has non-alphanumeric characters, otherwise it was pretty simple. I did still use AI with this one, but I didn't copy the code all the way through, and simply referenced it as a guide. It has a habit of over complicating things, which I'm glad I caught and didn't blindly follow what it spat out. Of course it was really helpful debugging, but credit where credit's due, I did learn a lot from it, and I did do quite a lot of work myself, especially in the CSS part. Good job me. Unfortunately we couldn't do the proper school loop I wanted, because I played games again, and also did running. Look at you balancing your hobbies and interests (except school). I'm proud of you doing that, but please don't neglect school. Good luck tomorrow, I'll see you soon.

### Day 21: August 25, 2024 (Sunday)

Hey hey I think I'm done for today. We were able to finish two projects today and I'm pretty proud of that. The first one was freeCodeCamp's simple date formatter which introduced me to the date object and how to use it. The only change I did was again with the UI and then I formatted the months to be their actual names instead of numbers. I planned to do more with the project, but I moved on to doing TOP's etch a sketch project. To be honest I still didn't know how to start this one. Practically all projects I couldn't start purely by myself. That just means I'm still pretty much a beginner at JavaScript. So yeah, ChatGPT did a lot of heavy lifting for me with this project. I mean I understand the code behind it, considering how little the code needed to function was, but to be honest it probably will take me some time to do this entirely by myself with no AI or with minimal searching. Still credit where credit's due, you did a great job with the UI, that we did'nt need help from and you also fixed some bugs which I know the past us wouldn't be able to do.

Keep going me, I might have less time tomorrow to prepare for the next school loop, but do still try to study web development as much as you can. Continue your readings and do the freeCodeCamp projects if that bores you. Good luck tomorrow.

### Day 20: August 24, 2024 (Saturday)

I finally finished TOP's JavaScript exercises today, but I gave in and started using AI to help me solve them. I did not solely rely on AI, it's only when I got stuck and couldn't find the answer elsewhere that I turned to it. This time though I promise that I won't be relying on it too much and always. I'm gonna make a conscious effort to only use it when necessary or after struggling for a while. After finishing the JavaScript exercises I went ahead and finished the rock paper scissors in the console project, and then read through the DOM Manipulation lesson. There's still the assignment left which is a lot of reading, but for now I'll continue in doing the Rock Paper Scissors project, this time with a UI. I'll come back to this after I hopefully finish it today.

### Day 19: August 23, 2024 (Friday)

Sup, it's the first day of our 4-day weekend, and I've done a bit of coding today, more than I did this past week. I'm hoping this will increase more tomorrow. Anyways, I first attempted to finish the TOP's JavaScript exercises, but I couldn't get all of them to work. I think I stopped at just exercise 4, because I couldn't solve it fast enough, and I didn't want to result to using AI to solve it, of course I still searched for answers, but I'm not sure if I did it right. So I switched to freeCodeCamp's JavaScript course, and I managed to finish the music player project today. I learned a lot about different string and array methods, and how to use them. Although our focus was a bit shifted earlier, I'm glad we still spent a lot of time on it today. Tomorrow I plan to learn some Android Development to prepare for our future project like I mentioned yesterday. I just need to be familiar with it. Also don't forget to practice some design skills while you're at it. Remember we're gonna be working primarily as a designer on our group activity, so even if you do know a bit of graphic design, UI and UX is a different field, and your Figma skills are not on par with your Photoshop skills.

Still try to squeeze in web development on your learning, because that's one career we see ourselves in, but also don't neglect what's important in your university studies - which right now is Android Development, and UI/UX Design. Good job today, keep it up.

### Day 18: August 22, 2024 (Thursday)

Hey tomorrow is the start of a long weekend and my goal is to finish or come close to finishing the Foundations course. We've been slacking off a lot this week, granted it's only our second week since going back to school, but we've been given an opportunity of a long weekend. Please don't waste this time doing unnecessary bs. I trust you know what to do. Don't fuck up.

Anyways today, I only partially read through the loops lesson in MDN, didn't even do the active recall lessons, but I started the TOP's javascript exercises, and had an experiment with npm through their exercises and learned briefly about Test Driven Development. Let's focus up tomorrow as soon as we wake up, ditch the phone, go straight to the laptop and start learning early in the morning. So even if we fuck up, which we probably will we'd have done some amount of studying early in the morning. Who knows once we get started with studying we just might not stop, so better to improve your chances and just do it in the morning. Also we need start preparing for our eventual group projects. I think I'll mostly be assuming a designer role, but that doesn't mean you have to neglect programming, especially the backend altogether. It pays to know a lot, and not just one. We can do both, and maybe more, it just needs a little more dedication and hard work.

Good luck tomorrow. Remember, go straight to studying as soon as you wake up.

### Day 17: August 21, 2024 (Wednesday)

I couldn't study some code today, but I did manage to redesign the calorie counter project, and finish it today. I just realized some features are not working as intended, and I plan to come back to it some time. The important thing is I managed to redesign yet another website adding to my experience. It's still practice and definitely not portfolio worthy. I haven't been researching much on these redesigns and basically just doing it raw. My process is basically get color, get fonts, do a basic layout in figma, then code. Good for practice, but in the real world I doubt they do that, so for my next project. I'm gonna try a little harder and actually do some research to my designs and improve my workflow. Anyways, gonna call it a day now and sleep. After tomorrow my schedule will be opening up again for almost week, so use that time wisely.

### Day 16: August 20, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hey hey, we're at Day 16, well kind of. I did some Java for the first time today. I reviewed for a bit early in the morning, but it wasn't enough because I pretty much had to rely on AI when doing our activity. I mean I can kinda understand most parts of it, but if I had to do everything from scratch, which I tried - I definitely would not succeed at that moment. We only had at best 2 hours to complete almost 10 exercises, so really that was my only choice. Don't worry though I still will avoid using AI on my separate studies. I just had to this time.

Other than some Java review on our classes, the only code-related thing I did was try to add some design to the previous calorie counter project I did on freeCodeCamp. That is until I distracted myself by playing League of Legends. Lock in :3

### Day 15: August 19, 2024 (Monday)

It's Day 15 and a Monday, I've only read some lessons again today. The first one where I had to install Node JS, and after that I've read a bit on arrays, again. If things go right tonight, and If I'm not sleepy I might review some Java for tomorrow. Still not used to the new schedule, but please try harder. Lock in.

### Day 14: August 18, 2024 (Sunday)

Can't believe it's been two weeks already. Although my pace is slowing down a lot, I'll eventually get that momentum back once I get used to going to school while simultaneously doing this. I only did one lesson today in The Odin Project about Clean Code. I spent way too much time gaming today, but I guess I'll let it slide since it's only once a week, and today is a weekend. I'll see you tomorrow, make sure to prepare for your classes.

### Day 13: August 17, 2024 (Saturday)

It's officially Day 13, and almost 2 weeks from when I first started this challenge. It's difficult doing this while I have classes and other responsibilities, but we kinda did this to ourselves because we didn't start sooner. But enough of the self blame, the second best thing is now, and you'll always have now, what's important is you keep taking action every now.

Anyways, short pep talk over - Today I attempted to build rock paper scissors from scratch, and failed, kind of. I'll try to fix it tomorrow, and finally finish watching some rock paper scissors tutorial on YouTube, because reading is still not enough for me. Prior to that I had finished the short rock paper scissors project in freeCodeCamp, but I kept it separate from The Odin Project, because I wanted to work within TOP's rules. I almost finished all the test cases, but yeah I encountered some bugs I wasn't able to fix yet. Still I did improve the design of the freeCodeCamp rock paper scissors, and I'm quite proud of that. Good job me.

It's only 6pm while I'm writing this, but I need to clear some of my backlogs, the most important being this video I need to record. I've set up Java in my VS Code, but I still need to review it, especially because we're doing Android Development for our course. I have some experience with it, but I remember not liking doing Android that much, hopefully it will change this time.

### Day 12: August 16, 2024 (Friday)

Hey it's Day 12, and I just finished the [Calorie Counter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#learn-form-validation-by-building-a-calorie-counter) project from freeCodeCamp. My online class was supposed to last until 8 PM, but luckily it didn't, giving me plenty of time to finally finish this lesson which took about 2 days I think, I remember being able to do one for less than a day, but yeah can't be helped since it's no longer summer and the challenge is to juggle both my independent studies and college, and not prioritize one over the other.

Anyways, while I didn't understand the full process of how this calorie counter was built - what's important is I learned some new concepts and techniques on how to build things. I think that's what great about freeCodeCamp, because even If I don't what is going on, I'm subconsciously learning some great practices that I'll keep using. It'd be great if I completely know the why, but right now I'm satisfied that I know the how of building something. I'll publish this project again, experiment on it and this time try to change more than the appearance of the project.

Good job today, enjoy your weekend, but don't forget what you gotta do. We're lacking some preparation that you'd really benefit from in the long run. Do those too, tomorrow aside from this. Keep going me.

### Day 11: August 15, 2024 (Thursday)

It's Day 11 now, and I have to admit that I was pretty "lazy" today. I went home from school at around 5 PM, which was plenty of time for me to study, but I didn't. Instead I spent this free time doing God knows what. I honestly don't know what happened, I'm probably just tired because this was the first time this week, that I went home kinda early, and didn't walk all the way from school.

I still did a few freeCodeCamp lessons today which were mainly about working with regex, but it didn't amount to an hour. I could've done more today, but hey you deserve some rest. Tomorrow, we have a full day of online classes, even if that's the case I think I can squeeze in some dev time. It may be difficult to do lessons while listening to classes, but I can definitely design and develop websites while that's happening, which I'll try again tomorrow.

Anyways, lock in. Remember your goals and push through even if you don't feel like it. Good luck tomorrow.

### Day 10: August 14, 2024 (Wednesday)

Yo it's Day 10, it's only 8:30 PM but I'm call it a day, because I'm tired. I managed to squeeze in some dev time during my easier subjects. Not necessarily easy but it was just a short orientation so I spent that time building and debugging the number guessing game from MDN. And just now I was able to fix one annoying bug, which was really just a simple fix. This is my fault for not trusting the Chrome Dev Tools, because I was entirely convinced that one element was causing the problem, until I inspected it and it was a completely different element, which I was then able to fix immediately. Always keep the developers tools open. Lesson learned. Trust the devtools, study the devtools.

Anyways after that I did a couple of freeCodeCamp lessons. I'm on the Building a Calorie Counter part, I hope I can continue more tomorrow. Goodnight, good luck and keep going.

### Day 9: August 13, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hello it's Day 9 and today was my shortest study session so far. I think I only crammed about an hour or so in the morning. I think I finished 2 lessons in The Odin Project today which was Problem Solving and Understanding Errors. I finally did one of MDN's active learning section earlier - the one about error handling, and they were pretty good. I finally forked their repo and I might just have to finish it all sometime.

After I got home from school, I finally attempted the rock paper scissors project, and then failed when I realized I still couldn't do it from scratch without searching for answers immediately. I figured I'll save this project for when I can comfortably do it without guides. That's when I made the switch to freeCodeCamp again and finished one quick lesson earlier, surprisingly about debugging. I also practiced my frontend skills a bit by improving the UI of said project. I think I'll stick with freeCodeCamp for now at least until I finish their rock paper scissors project, which they also have. Anyways, good job again today, keep doing this.

### Day 8: August 12, 2024 (Monday)

Hey it's Day 8, and today was the first day of me being a 3rd Year Computer Science Student. The subject was calculus earlier and we reviewed Algebra, which I embarrassingly struggled with a lot. I will definitely get back on reviewing Algebra. Do not make this an excuse. WE CAN DO BOTH. We just need to plan things better, it's only the first week things will get better, you'll find your groove.

Anyways, back to our independent studies. You made the right decision earlier of doing this early in the morning when you still had time. Tomorrow we might not have enough time, but try to squeeze in at least an hour of just reading shit and immersing yourself to the programming culture. I think we have some spare time in between classes you can use that. Read when you can't code. It still counts.

Now back to what we accomplished today. I only managed to kinda complete one lesson in Odin which was about Problem Solving. After that I went ahead and played around with the freeCodeCamp project I did yesterday, and I just finished it, check it out [here](https://adiluexe.github.io/basic-js-rpg/) in all it's mediocre glory.

I did not add a lot in the JavaScript part of the code. It's mostly improving the copywriting and design of things, which I'm still proud of. I added new description objects for the monsters; updated the dialogue and options; and overhauled the entire UI. My JavaScript skills still suck, but I'm definitely getting better at CSS and the frontend side of things. Of course I'm still confused on why it's not being responsive like I thought it would, I keep using `100vh` for the landing page and it's not working right when the page content is larger than that or when I scale it down. But that's beside the point, I made stuff today, just keep making stuff, eventually everything will just be natural to you. Keep going me, good luck, and see you tomorrow.

### Day 7: August 11, 2024 (Sunday)

It's officially been a week since I started learning how to code, again (fr this time). I'm 75% through TOP's Foundation Course in just a week! This took me months when I first stumbled upon this course. That being said, I wasn't speeding through or anything, in fact I only kinda finished one lesson today in TOP, which was the Function Basics along with its assignment. There were a lot of readings that I skimmed through and plan to read through again tomorrow. This time I once again focused on freeCodeCamp, specifically the [Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game) project which I finished in one sitting today. My plan tomorrow is to maybe finish the TOP lessons until the first project, and then revamp the project I just finished in freeCodeCamp.

I know that we'll be starting of our classes tomorrow, but don't make that an excuse you know you can squeeze in at least 2 hours of your time everyday with this. We've always done well at school, somehow, but I know you also realize that being just good at university and having high grades isn't enough. I'm not asking you to prioritize one thing over another, I'm asking you to do both, and I know you can. Do well in class, while also doing your independent studies. I'm proud of you. Keep going. I'll see you tomorrow, and everyday after that.

### Day 6: August 10, 2024 (Saturday)

Day 6 and almost a week through. Today I started learning about JavaScript. I only managed to complete 2 lessons in the JavaScript basics of TOP. There was too much reading involved about something I'm not used to yet. I figured rather than force myself into that and kill my momentum (I almost didn't wanna study today), I should just switch resources, which was part of my plan after all. That's why I started freeCodeCamp's JS Course. I managed to finish the first two projects, which gave me the motivation to read through the lessons set by TOP, which was still hard to go through.

I kinda skipped over the Dev Tools part again, but tomorrow I'll watch like a couple videos on it instead. I was surprised that I was able to study for around 5 hours today, because I did not start off motivated with all the reading. Good on you for having plans in case this happens, and following through with it.

If TOP is getting difficult for you, switch to freeCodeCamp, if even that is getting to be too difficult for you, watch some videos about the topic, and if that still doesn't work - take a break. You might just be tired. Anyways, good job for today, keep at it.

### Day 5: August 9, 2024 (Friday)

Day 5. I just finished the Flexbox section, including the flexbox exercises, and the landing page project. I pretty much finished the flexbox exercises in under and hour this time, and without looking anything up. That's right no Google, no ChatGpt, just pure experience. I remember struggling with this section when I first encountered, and me taking like almost a week to finish it all. Naturally, my confidence was at an all time high having finished something I struggled with for days, in less than an hour.

I thought I had mastered CSS layouts by now, but when I attempted the landing page page - I realized I still had a long way to go. I particularly struggled with how my sections keep overlapping, and overflowing with each other. But credit where credit's due :3, I did do this in like 2 hours while watching The Umbrella Academy on the side, and I did eventually fix it.

Keep going me, we spent a little over 6 hours today, I'm proud of you.

### Day 4: August 8, 2024 (Thursday)

Sup it's Day 4 and I'm 56% through the Foundations Course. I just finished the margin and padding css exercises and I'm gonna end today there, tomorrow we'll start with Flexbox and hopefully at the JavaScript section which I'm still struggling with.

We basically started off today at the Commit Messages lesson which I reread, then did the recipes project. I still haven't added the styles yet for that, but I'm definitely gonna do like a big project with it when I'm almost done with the Foundations Course which I believe we can do for about a month, since we've already progressed through it 2 times, and now's the third. Anyways, I pretty much breezed through the CSS lessons and the exercises. I did kinda skip through the Chrome Dev Tools part, I'll save that for next time, I figured rather than force myself to study that part and lose momentum, I'd rather save it for another time where I'll absolutely need it. I did like knowing about the `CSS Overview` part of the Dev Tools. Now that's something that I know is immediately useful for me.

We also spent around 4 hours today, good job again. Classes are coming up soon, but I hope you still remember to do these independent studies and keep logging here. Again, good job me.

### Day 3: August 7, 2024 (Wednesday)

Yo it's Day 3 and my mom's birthday, someday I hope to give her the life she deserves.

I'm 41% through the Foundations Course in The Odin Project (TOP), I'm right about done with the Commit Messages lesson, but I will read through it again tomorrow. I basically blitzed through the HTML sections and read the additional sources in case there's some info I missed. I recently finished the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course so I think I'll revisit that if my HTML still needs some work.

I spent around 4 hours studying today, the longest session we've had so far. You're doing great me, keep it up.

### Day 2: August 6, 2024 (Tuesday)

Hey it's Day 2 and I'm 20% through with the Foundations Course, I'm almost finished with the Prerequisites section, I spent almost 4 hours today with The Odin Project, about 1 hour of that was trying to setup WSL2 in my device. I had installed it previously, but I thought It wasn't working so I reinstalled it again, and that's where I encountered some problems and spent extra time on, but it's all hopefully over.

I mostly learned about computers today, and some background on the web and basically things related to it. I'm nearly done with the Command Line Basics, but I think It's better if I finish it tomorrow. It's currently 8pm while I'm writing this and I'm gonna call it day, need to rest even if I think I could still do more. You deserve it, keep up the good work.

### Day 1: August 5, 2024 (Monday)

I started The Odin Project from the beginning for like I think the 3rd time again. (This time will be different ;3).

I'm 10% through the Foundations Course, having just finished reading through the Introduction section. I think I spent a total of 3 hours studying today, I definitely could've done more, regardless, good job me.

Mostly learned about how to develop the mindset that will make help me succeed in everything. Here's to making it.
